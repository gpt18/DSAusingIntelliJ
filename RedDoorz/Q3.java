 * 
 * A neighborhood of Park Street is raided by soldiers in search of Agent Y. They land on different buildings on a helicopter. The rooftops of these buildings are connected to each other through ladders. Each soldier can take control of the buildings in a straight line (left-right and forward-backward), with respect to the building/position they have been dropped at. They cannot take control of buildings diagonally.
 * 
 * There are 8 buildings in each row and column. Your goal is to determine and return the total number of buildings that are controlled by these group of soldiers.
 * 
 * Note: A soldier also controls the building on which he/she is currently positioned dropped.
